# Identification of person with mask using Deep Learning 
Medical researchers around the globe provide evidence that COVID19 pandemic diseases 
transmitted through droplets and respirators of respiratory aerosols and wearing a face mask is an 
efficient infection control recommendation process. In addition, many public and private service 
providers demand that consumers use the service only if they wear masks properly. However, a few 
research studies have been found on face mask detection based on the technology of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Image Processing. 
In this article, we propose, Mobile Net Mask, which is a deep learning-based multi-phase face 
mask detection, Haarcascaded classifier model for preventing human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
Two different face mask datasets with 1,000 images have been utilized to train and test the model for 
detecting with and without a face mask from the images and video stream.
